# Project Updates

## Pending Features

1. **Create Time Table**: This feature is currently not implemented as it is quite complicated and will require more time to develop.

2. **Teacher Attendance Push Notification**: This feature is not done as it requires a token key and project ID. Instead, a push email option has been implemented. With this feature, teachers can send an email to notify students that their attendance has been taken.
